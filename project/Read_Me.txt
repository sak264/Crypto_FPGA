The folder contains 7 codes one for each model.
 Out of these the neural_net_test_script.ipynb also contains code for converting
the test set spectrograms into a .csv formatted file. Other codes are based on
testing single audio files and can be converted to desired form using code from neural_net_test_script.ipynb.


The models folder contains wts and models for all codes and are name accordingly.
Make appropriate changes in the codes to load the desired model since their names might
differ in codes.
